compute a probability p that a given star of standard classification, composition by spectral information and solar mass would supernovae, define a function isSupernovae to compute the probabaility.

The probability of a given star of standard classification, composition by spectral information, and solar mass undergoing a supernova is difficult to determine with certainty. However, astronomers have identified several factors that can increase the likelihood of a star undergoing a supernova, including its mass, metallicity, and age.

To compute the probability that a given star will undergo a supernova, we can use the following function:

python

def isSupernovae(star_mass, star_metallicity, star_age):
    if star_mass < 8:
        return 0  # Stars less than 8 solar masses do not typically undergo supernovae
    elif star_metallicity < 0.1:
        return 0.25  # Low metallicity stars have a higher likelihood of undergoing supernovae
    elif star_age < 3e7 or star_age > 1e9:
        return 0.5  # Young or old stars have a higher likelihood of undergoing supernovae
    else:
        return 0.1  # For all other stars, we assume a low probability of undergoing a supernova

In this function, we first check if the star's mass is less than 8 solar masses. Stars with less than 8 solar masses typically do not undergo supernovae and so we return a probability of 0.

If the star's mass is greater than or equal to 8 solar masses, we check its metallicity. Stars with low metallicity (less than 0.1) have a higher likelihood of undergoing supernovae due to the lack of heavy elements needed for nuclear fusion. In this case, we return a probability of 0.25.

Next, we check the star's age. Young or old stars (less than 30 million years or greater than 1 billion years) have a higher likelihood of undergoing supernovae due to their stage of evolution. In this case, we return a probability of 0.5.

Finally, for all other stars, we assume a low probability of undergoing a supernova and return a probability of 0.1.

It's important to note that this function is a simplified model and does not take into account all the complex factors that can influence whether or not a star will undergo a supernova. Additionally, this function should not be used to make predictions about specific stars, but rather as a general guide to understanding the factors that can influence the likelihood of a star undergoing a supernova.


A dataset of star parameters is available from the linear sky survey and a scan to compute probabailites is executed on teh decision tree, and a threshold TT, used to create a list of possible candidates. These are imaged using a combination of mobile, drone and telescope images to point cloud with VSLAM and metaverse.
